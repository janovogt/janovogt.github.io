    <p>
        These are some of my favorite books and this is just some text to fill up space so that I can check what the modifications in my css sheet are actually doing. I think it's very cool to have your own website but also feel like it's a bit overkill in my case.

    <p>
        why should you care aboit integritry? Well, in my opinion integrity is one the best and most stable fundaments for leading a good life.

        I need this text as a place holder so that I can test wethter the table of contents works as intended. Probably it does, but if the page is not long enough, I don't see anything happening when clicking the links. So I am just going to write some text and hopefully everything functions properly now.
